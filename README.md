# Asteroid_Avoiders
This is a simple asteroid avoider game. The game is currently very choppy and is in its early stages.


To upload the game to your computer you will need too download all files exept LICENSE. After you to that you want to make a folder to store all the files in. All the files must be stored in the same folder otherwise the game will not work. Once that is complete you are going to want to open index.html, this file will open in your browser and you will be able to play the game.

Likewise if you have PHP installed on your computer you can open command prompt and type ```php -S localhost:8000```. This will open up port 8000 on your local wifi. You can now access the app by going into the browser and typing "http://localhost:8000"
